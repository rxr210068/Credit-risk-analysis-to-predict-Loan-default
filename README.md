# Credit-risk-analysis-to-predict-Loan-default
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and trusts. Financial organizations should analyze credit applications based on unbiased methods to prevent economic and social damages and reduce credit risks. Statistical models help in this process of evaluating the risk with unbiased techniques which otherwise is subject to sentimental and human errors. For this reason, algorithms integrating various criteria and models have been developed to predict risk-based credit scores. Since default risk refers to the risk of loss that stems from credit users’ incapability to meet the responsibilities of the previously granted credit, estimating default probability is critical for effective credit risk management. Keeping these factors in mind, we want to create a model to assess credit risk of a home loan applicant based on characteristic of the applicant; including past payment behavior and predict the applicant’s likelihood to default.

**DATA SET: HMEQ**
The HMEQ dataset contains loan performance information for 5960 home equity loans. The Target variable (BAD) indicates if an applicant defaulted on loan/seriously delinquent (value 1) or applicant paid loan (value 0). Other than the target variable, there are 12 independent variables.
